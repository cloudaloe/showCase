###Where is the code?
The browser-side code is inside directory <code> code</code>.

###What's else in this root directory?
What's needed for running a server that will serve the browser-side code to a browser.  
This miniscule server also serves csv files for injecting test data.

###Running the included server
To run the included server, execute: <code> node server.js</code> (or double-click the sibling windows batch file), after you have node.js installed.  
You may then enter [http://localhost:1338/showCase.html] (http://localhost:1338/showCase.html) in your browser.
